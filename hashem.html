        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Hashem, and outside of my work, I have several hobbies that keep me inspired and energized. Here's a bit more about what I enjoy doing in my free time.
        </p>
        <!-- Camping Section -->
        <section id="camping">
            <h3>Camping Adventures</h3>
            <p>
                There's nothing quite like the great outdoors. I love camping and getting away from life. Whether it's hiking through the mountains or setting up camp by a lake, I’m always ready for the next adventure!
            </p>

        <!-- Art Section -->
        <section id="art">
            <h3>Creating Art</h3>
            <p>
                Art has always been a creative outlet for me. I enjoy sketching, painting, and even experimenting with digital art. It’s a way for me to express myself and unwind.

        <!-- Video Games Section -->
        <section id="gaming">
            <h3>Video Games</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a big fan of video games, especially strategy games. There's nothing quite like solving puzzles, building strategies, or going on epic adventures, all from the comfort of my couch.

        <section id="friends">
            <h3>Hanging Out with Friends</h3>
            <p>
                Spending time with friends is something I always look forward to. Whether we're playing games, exploring new spots, or just relaxing, it's all about making memories.
