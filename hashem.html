                Hi there! I'm Hashem. I was born on the 16th of January 2004, and I'm going to tell you a bit about myself. First things first, speed facts: 
                I'm a twin (me, my twin, and my little sister circa 2012), I'm from Amman, Jordan, and I really love Harry Potter. Outside of my work, I have several hobbies that keep me sane and grounded. Here's a bit more about what I enjoy doing in my free time.
            </p>

    <h2>Touching Grass</h2>
    <p>
        There's nothing quite like the great outdoors (though as a CS major I rarely get to see it). I love being outdoors and getting away from life. Whether it's hiking through the mountains or trekking through the desert, I’m always ready to breathe clean air!

                Cooking has always been a rewarding experience for me. I love experimenting with new recipes, flavors, and techniques to create delicious meals. It’s a way for me to unwind, get creative, and share joy with others.
